# vpr_meas
Video Plankton Recorder Measurement Analysis. Reading in measurement data from ImageJ and analysis and manipulation in R


# Description
Workflow files for analysis of measurement data collected by ImageJ on VPR images. Of particular interest would be the `functions.R` file and `Analysis_Template.Rmd` which provide reproducible tools to do future analyses. 

This repository also includes the ImageJ batch processing file `vpr_batch.ijm` which can be opened in FIJI (ImageJ), to process and extract measurements from ROI images. The instructions for this process are included as a word doc (Image J Instructions for VPR users)
